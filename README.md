# Titanic-Prediction
The Titanic Survival Prediction is a basic Machine Learning model which I built with the help of Random Forest classifier. By splitting the data into train and test data, the model was trained accordingly. Prediction was if a given passenger survived the shipwreck. The model scored 0.77511.
